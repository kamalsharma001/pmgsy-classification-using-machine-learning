Intelligent classification of PMGSY projects using XGBoost, trained &amp; deployed on IBM Cloud Watsonx.

# Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects

This project classifies road and bridge projects under the **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)** into their respective schemes 
(PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, PMGSY-III, RCPLWEA) using **XGBoost Classifier**, trained and deployed on **IBM Cloud Watsonx.ai**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Manual classification of thousands of PMGSY projects is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.  
This project proposes an AI-based solution that **automatically classifies projects** into schemes based on physical and financial attributes.

---

## ⚙️ Solution Approach
- Data sourced from **AI Kosh PMGSY dataset**.  
- Attributes used: road length, sanctioned works, completed works, bridges, expenditure, etc.  
- Trained a **supervised learning model (XGBoost Classifier)**.  
- Deployed on **IBM Cloud Lite with Watsonx.ai** (no external stack used).  

---

## 📊 Results
The model accurately predicts the correct PMGSY scheme with probability scores.  
Sample outputs and visuals are included in the **PPT file**.
